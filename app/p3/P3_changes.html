                <h2>Changes design</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="box-content">
					<p> We had a meeting with our client in the middle of the project. Most of the changes we present here is requested by the client.</p>
                <h4>Navigation bar and header</h4>
					<p> We changed the header so it would contain more space. We removed home because it had the same function as the logo (to go to the homepage). We also compiled knowledge center and registration under the dropdown "resources". </p>
					<p> The map in  the footer was "too much" and was replaced by social media buttons. </p>
					<p> As we mentioned was a possibility in P2 we decided to have a static background image below the header</p>
                    <p> It was decided against having the cart in javascript in the header, because we had to hardcode the items in the cart for this project. We have replaced this javascript requirement with a javascript in knowledge-center that handles the articles.</p>
				<h4>homepage.html</h4>
					<p>The site-wide picture of the storefront was removed because of the lack of a high quality photo to make it representable. Other than that the content is the same. We also added icons for the knowledge center, about and store to make the page more intuitiv.</p>
					<p>The initial map placement was replaced with a photo of the store owners to make the page "homely" aswell as professional. The map is therefore placed in the bottom of the page.</p>
				<h4>about-us.html</h4>
                    <p>It was added another row to this page where the clients collaborators also was presented. </p>
                    <p>The employees was changed to 3 instead of 6 for this project only. The client did not have photos yet of the other employees.</p>
                <h4>contact-us.html</h4>
                    <p>No major changes</p>
                <h4>knowledge-center.html and article.html</h4>
                    <p>As mentioned over we removed a javascript file and added another to meet the minimum javascript requirements.
                    We decided to add javascript to handle the articles since the knowledge-center and articles have identical site structure and the flow of the page will feel smoother.
                    This means that we also remove the article1.html as the content will be included in knowledge-center.html.
                    </p>
                <h4>registration.html</h4>
                    <p>No major changes</p>
                <h4>store.html</h4>
                    <p>The introduction to the category was removed because it was self explainatory</p>
                    <p>The width of each box was changed becasue the original size felt too small</p>
                <h4>dog.htnl</h4>
                    <p>The width of each box was changed becasue the original planned size felt too small</p>
                <h4>product1.html</h4>
                    <p>No major changes</p>
                <h4> cart.html </h4>
                    <p>We moved the cart confirmation to the top so the customer can verify the content of the cart in the start, so the content is correct from the start</p>
