			</div>
			<div class="box-content">
                <h4>Brief Summary of testing content</h4>
                <p>The test is compiled of 3 use cases and a general section. Use case 1: You have to send a message to the store. Use case 2: You have to order a product. Use case 3: You have to register as a costumer </p>
                <p>The questions revolve around the usability and how hard each of these cases was to complete. They also get asked if they had any problems completing the task and if they have any input on how we can improve the flow of the tasks</p>
                <p>The last section they was asked to browse the page as they liked for a few minutes before answering the questions. It was general questions about age, device used, browser used, their first impression, how they liked the design, what was frustrating with the page, and if they have any input on improvements. </p>

                <h2>4. Tester Audience</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="box-content">
                <p>We tested the webpage with the client and the stores employees/collaboration partners. We also reached out to some fellow students on facebook. In total 12 people tested our page, whereof five are employees/partners of the store and seven are students. This gives us a rate of 58,3% students and 41,6% employees.</p>
                <p>Considering that the webpage is for a pet store we asked the test-subjects if they owned a pet to ensure that we got some valuable feedback from the audience that would match the stores target audience the most.</p>

                <h2>5. Testing Platforms</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="box-content">
                <p>The majority of our testers used a computer to access the webpage. Almost everyone who used a computer used Google Chrome, but we also had a couple of Internet Explorer users and Safari users too. Of those who used a mobile unit Google Chrome and Safari were the only used browsers.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="box-content">
                <h4>Design:</h4>
                <p>Our testers were very positive to the design. They liked the light colors and found it very pleasing to the eyes. We were also complimented on the uncluttered and clean design.</p>
                <h4>Navigating the website:</h4>
                <p>Our testers managed to navigate the page without any problems, except some found it a bit unintuitive for the customer registration to be under "ressurser" (resources). The testers liked that the menu was always available at the top for easy navigation throughout the site. Our testers did find a bug with the hamburger menu not working on the store page because of a problem with having window.onload in two different javascripts on the same page. We will fix this.</p>
                <h4>Using the store:</h4>
                <p>Our testers had no problems navigating the store to find what they were asked to and they liked the way the items were categorized. It was a bit confusing for them that all the categories led to the same page and all the products did too.</p>

                <h2>7. Your Response</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="box-content">
                <h4>Design:</h4>
                <p>We were thankful for the kind words and it was great that they liked the design we worked so hard on.</p>
                <h4>Navigating the website:</h4>
                <p>We understand it can be confusing that the customer registration is under "ressurser", but we arent going to change it because the registration is meant to be only for the customers to send their information to the store so they can be manually registered as customers in their local system. We are going to put a little explanation on the site though. The bug with the hamburger menu was great that they found, because it is critical for the navigation of the site that the menu works when the site is diplayed on a mobile phone.</p>
                <h4>Using the store:</h4>
                <p>Even though the categories and items were a bit confusing we explained that it was because of the limitation of how many html-files we could have. If it werent for that limitation every item and category would of course have its own page.</p>

				<h2>8. Self Reflection</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="box-content">
                <p>We have learned that its very nice to have a detailed plan of what needs to be done, so theres no doubt about major design elements and stuff like that. We've also found out that user testing is very important and can uncover flaws and bugs we probably never would have found ourselves. <p>
