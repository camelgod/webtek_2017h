                <h4>Brief Summary of testing content</h4>
                <p>The test is compiled of 3 use cases and a general section. Use case 1: You have to send a message to the store. Use case 2: You have to order a product. Use case 3: You have to register as a costumer </p>
                <p>The questions revolve around the usability and how hard each of these cases was to complete. They also get asked if they had any problems completing the task and if they have any input on how we can improve the flow of the tasks</p>
                <p>The last section they was asked to browse the page as they liked for a few minutes before answering the questions. It was general questions about age, device used, browser used, their first impression, how they liked the design, what was frustrating with the page, and if they have any input on improvements. </p>

                <h2>4. Tester Audience</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="box-content">
                <p>We tested the webpage with the client and the stores employees/collaboration partners. We also reached out to some fellow students on facebook. In total 12 people tested our page, whereof five are employees/partners of the store and seven are students. This gives us a rate of 58,3% students and 41,6% employees.</p>
                <p>Considering that the webpage is for a pet store we asked the test-subjects if they owned a pet to ensure that we got some valuable feedback from the audience that would match the stores target audience the most.</p>
                <p>We also did internal testing</p>

			</div>
			<div class="box-content">
                <p>All of our testers used a computer to access the webpage. The browser used was Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.</p>
                <p>We did internal testing with mobile and computers, and with Google Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. </p>

                <h2>6. Feedback Summary</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="box-content">
                <h4>Design:</h4>
                <p>Our testers was positive to the design. They liked the light colors and found it generally pleasing. They thought it "clean" but some also thought it was "too clean". It was also wanted to see more photos of animals so it was clear that this was a pet store. The first impression was generally good.x </p>
                <h4>Navigating the website:</h4>
                <p>Our testers encountered some problems, especially with the navigation to the registration form. S ome found it a bit unintuitive for the customer registration to be under "ressurser" (resources). The testers liked that the menu was always available at the top for easy navigation throughout the site. </p>
                <h4>Using the store:</h4>
                <p>Our testers had major problems using the store, and we discovered it was a techincal issure with the stepper javascript. Before getting to the cart there was not any registered  problems navigating the store to find what they were asked. It was a bit confusing for them that all the categories led to the same page and all the products did too.</p>
                <h4>Bugs found:</h4>
                <p>There was a bug with the hamburger menu not working on the store page because of a problem with having window.onload in two different javascripts on the same page.</p>
                <p>The stepper function in the cart didn't work, as it did in the internal testing</p>
                <p>Internet Explorer bugs: Footer got too broad, instagram-logo dind't reduce size correctly. Links on the homepage was broken (didn't lead to correct places)</p>

                <h2>7. Your Response</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="box-content">
                <h4>Design:</h4>
                <p>We are grateful that most of the tester liked the design of the webpage and had no major concerns about the design. We will also take into consideration in the future to try to make the page not too "sterile" and try to alter the design so it includes more pet-related photos.</p>
                <h4>Navigating the website:</h4>
                <p>We understand it can be confusing that the customer registration is under "ressurser", but we arent going to change it because the registration is meant to be only for the customers to send their information to the store so they can be manually registered as customers in their local system. We are going to put a little explanation on the site so this will be communicated clearly to the customers.</p>
                <h4>Using the store:</h4>
                <p>Even though the categories and items were a bit confusing we explained that it was because of the limitation of how many html-files we could have. If it werent for that limitation every item and category would of course have its own page. This will be dynamic in the non-static</p>
                <h4>Bugs:</h4>
                <p>was great that they found, because it is critical for the navigation of the site that the menu works when the site is diplayed on a mobile phone.</p>
                <p>The stepper cart crashing was a major problem, but we managed to fix it before the delivery of the project. The stepper cart should function as normal.</p>
                <p>We also managed to fix the other bugs that was mentioned.</p>

				<h2>8. Self Reflection</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="box-content">
                <p>We have learned that its very nice to have a detailed plan of what needs to be done, so theres no doubt about major design elements and stuff like that. We've also found out that user testing is very important and can uncover flaws and bugs we probably never would have found ourself. The internal testing we did was also very useful and we tried to do as much internal testing as we could. We discovered also that it is very important that we have a clean code, since many of our bugs came from code that wasn't clean.</p>
